Home Recognition will be a mobile application that allows users to take a photo of a house,
upload it to the app, and receive data from the app that will inform them of the architectural
style(s) of the house. When a photo is uploaded, the app will send the photo to the app back-end
and the machine learning model will categorize the home into a percentage spread of different
styles that fit the home the best. For convenience and doability, the app will be limited to
American home architecture styles such as Colonial, Tudor Revival, etc.
When a user takes a photo in-app, the app will log the location where they took the photo and
store it in their database. In order for users to utilize this feature, they must have created an
account so their information can be attached to their profile. Users have the ability to see the map
view and see nearby usersâ€™ uploads regardless of whether or not they have created an account. In
addition, the app will have another tab where users can read up on the different architectural
styles the app detects, such as the history and distinct features of the style.
