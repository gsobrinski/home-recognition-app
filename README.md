# Home Recognition
## Grace Sobrinski, Cam Gallagher, Emily Trinh, Madison Stock, & Rory Giszter

Home Recognition will be a mobile application that allows users to take a photo of a house, upload it to the app, and receive data from the app that will 
inform them of the architectural style(s) of the house. When a photo is uploaded, the app will send the photo to the app back-end and the machine learning model 
will categorize the home into a percentage spread of different styles that fit the home the best. For convenience and doability, the app will be limited to 
American home architecture styles such as Colonial, Tudor Revival, etc. When a user takes a photo in-app, the app will log the location where they took the photo 
and store it in their database. In order for users to utilize this feature, they must have created an account so their information can be attached to their profile.
Users have the ability to see the map view and see nearby usersâ€™ uploads regardless of whether or not they have created an account. In addition, the app will have
another tab where users can read up on the different architectural styles the app detects, such as the history and distinct features of the style.
